The main subject of the password generator is to have the user easily create a password.
Depending on how in strong the password needs to be the user can choose a few options.
How long do you need the Password?(There is a min of 8 characters and a max of 128 characters)
Does it need a UpperCase?
Does it need a LowerCase?
Does it need a Number?
Does it need a Special Character?
Once all options are picked the Password Generator will automatically create a password for the user.
Once the Passworn Generator creates a password it will then generate it on the website for the user!
